# Stock Analysis

## Overview

Writing and executing code on the first attempt is not always the best way to accomplish a task. A key part of coding is refactoring code. The goal of refactoring code is to make the existing code more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, and/or improving the logic. This process can also be used to make the code easier to read for future users. 

### Purpose

The code developed does its job. However, it might not be efficient or work as well for thousands of stocks. The purpose of this analysis is to refactor the code and determine whether the scrip runs faster.
